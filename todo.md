## Things to sort out (check TODOs as well I guess)

- Register subscription to eventsub from welcome message id provided above
- Get a stream of messages from a twitch chat
- Render view feed of twitch chat as a view model

## Things I want to do

- Server that local apps can subscribe to or query for based on stream events
- Add custom inputs to interact with stream events
- Chat bot
- TTS
