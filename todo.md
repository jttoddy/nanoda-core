## Things to sort out (check TODOs as well I guess)

- Add some kind of logger so we can debug internals
- logger should append label to all messages
- Verify that we get a welcome_message from eventsub <-- YOU ARE HERE
- Register subscription to eventsub from welcome message id provided above
- Get a stream of messages from a twitch chat
- Render view feed of twitch chat as a view model

## Things I want to do

- Server that local apps can subscribe to or query for based on stream events
- Add custom inputs to interact with stream events
- Chat bot
- TTS
